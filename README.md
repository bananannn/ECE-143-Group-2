Analysis of Uber Movement Data for the city of Los Angeles

## Problem:

Gathering and understanding Uber Movement data for the city of Los Angeles given the location data and the month of the year.

## Dataset:

Uber Movement dataset (https://ubr.to/2JvIdNA)

The entire dataset comprises of 6 CSV files, for 4 different quarters of the year 2017 and one quarter of the year 2018 along with one map JSON file for Los Angeles. The files comprise of Source ID, Destination ID, Month of the Year, Mean Travel Time for the city of Los Angeles. 

## Proposed Solution and  Real-world applications:

We propose to understand the urban mobility of the city of Los Angeles using data visualization tools such as bar graphs, pie charts, heat maps of LA locations etc. to comprehend the travel duration given the source, destination and month of the year. The solution would be used to understand the urban mobility of Los Angeles given the month of the year. This would be useful to make informed decisions about adapting existing infrastructure (parking structures/ roadblocks, etc) for a more efficient traffic flow.
